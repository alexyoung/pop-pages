Pop version 0.0.1 has been released:

* GitHub: [alexyoung / pop](https://github.com/alexyoung/pop)

This includes [stextile](https://github.com/alexyoung/stextile), which is a rough-and-ready [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) parser.  Pop also supports [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Pop sites use [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/).  These are CSS selector-based shorthands for quickly writing HTML and CSS.
