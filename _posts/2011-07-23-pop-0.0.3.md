Pop version 0.0.3 is out.

* Atom feed helper takes less options (the variables are all in `config`)
* Atom feed uses `config.perPage`
* Post file names with extra dots will be parsed correctly
* YAML front-matter will be extracted less greedily
* YAML front-matter can now contain a `summary` property to make it easier to display post summaries in lists
* Trailing slashes will be removed from `config.url`
