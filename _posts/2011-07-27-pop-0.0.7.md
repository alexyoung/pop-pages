Pop 0.0.7 is out:

* Added generators
* Plugins can add their own generators through `myPlugin.generators`
* `SiteBuilder` should trigger the server properly

## Using Generators

Generating a site with Pop generally works like this:

    pop new new_site

Generators can now be used to generate different kinds of sites:

    pop new pop-gallery new_site

This example requires [pop-gallery](https://github.com/alexyoung/pop-gallery).

## Writing Generators

Basic usage is to make a CommonJS module with a `generator` property:

    module.exports = {
      generator: {
        run: function(helpers, pathName) {
        }
      }
    };

The parameters will be passed by Pop.  The `helpers` value contains the internal cli_tools.js module, and <code>pathName</code> is the destination path for the site.

A full example is available here: [pop-gallery](https://github.com/alexyoung/pop-gallery).
