Pop 0.0.4 is out:

* Running `pop` will generate a site in the current directory and exit
* Running `pop` on a path that doesn't look like a Pop site will print an error rather than a confusing stack trace
* Pop server mode will watch all subdirectories for changes, so things like stylesheets (including Stylus files) will automatically regenerate the changed file
